MENTOR: NEELA SANTHOSH

As part of my front-end internship at CodTech, I was given the opportunity to build a PORTFOLIO using HTML, CSS. This task marked the beginning of my journey into real-world web development, and I chose to complete it using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), which made the entire learning process much smoother and enjoyable.
The main goal of this task was to create a simple PORTFOLIO where users could access my information much easier. At first, it seemed like a small project, but as I began writing the code, I realized how many important web development concepts were involved. I started by designing the basic structure using HTMLâ€”creating sections for headings, insider paragraph, and the smooth navigation. This helped me understand how important HTML is as the backbone of any web page.
Next, I worked on styling the app using CSS. This part was fun and creative, as I learned how to add colors, spacing, and layout features to make the portfolio look clean and responsive. It gave me a better understanding of how CSS enhances the user experience and makes an interface visually appealing.finally it was a great experience to learnt about this all and also im looking forward to learn a lot.
